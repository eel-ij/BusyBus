# **Busy Bus**

##### A public transit app with responsive UI
Busy Bus was a project I did during my time with Bloc, which is a programing bootcamp. I was assigned to conduct user surveys and interviews, and provide competitive analysis. With the data collected from the research, I created user stories, personas, and flows to aid with the wireframing stage. During the frontend development, I used HTML and CSS keeping in mind to make a responsive model.
